      <p>Whimsical justification for not being interested</p>

        Conceptual knowledge becomes a nebula that is incompletely transmitted
        by osmosis
      </p>
      <p>Concepts and theories are whirled into incomplete summaries</p>
      <p>Emptied and refilled by the intention to know</p>
      <p>transformed into a meme by the need for synthesis</p>
      <p>only boomers explain things</p>
      <p>In the near future nobody will read</p>
      <p>The world will be divided between</p>
      <p> those who do not know how to read</p>
      <p> those who pretend to know how to read</p>

        The cognitive power of language interpretation shifted from lineal
        articulation to morphological association
      </p>
      <p>Our minds are drawn to interpret lines, vectors and colors</p>
      <p>transforming letters into hieroglyphs</p>

        impossibility of understanding words
